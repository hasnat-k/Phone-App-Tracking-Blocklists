# Phone App Tracking Blocklists

Welcome to the Phone App Tracking Blocklists repository! This project contains a curated list of app tracking domains that can be blocked via DNS or other privacy tools. By blocking these domains, you can protect your privacy from unwanted tracking by phone applications.

## App Tracking Domains

Here are the app tracking domains that are recommended for blocking:

### **Tracking Domains for AdColony**

- adc3-launch.adcolony.com
- adcolony.com
- ads30.adcolony.com
- androidads20.adcolony.com
- androidads21.adcolony.com
- androidads23.adcolony.com
- events3alt.adcolony.com
- wd.adcolony.com

### **Tracking Domains for AccountKit**

- graph.accountkit.com

### **Tracking Domains for Amazon Advertisement**

- NC (This domain is excluded from the blocklist as it is used for internal tracking purposes and should not be blocked.)

## How to Use the Blocklists

You can use these blocklists in a variety of ways:

- **DNS-Based Solutions**: Configure these domains with DNS servers like Pi-Hole, AdGuard, or your router's DNS settings to block the tracking domains.
- **Hosts File Redirection**: Download the blocklist and replace your system's hosts file to block these domains locally.
- **Browser Extensions**: For users who want to block these domains in their browsers, you can use extensions like uBlock Origin and configure them with these lists.
