# Phone App Tracking Blocklists

Welcome to the Phone App Tracking Blocklists repository! This project contains a curated list of app tracking domains that can be blocked via DNS or other privacy tools. By blocking these domains, you can protect your privacy from unwanted tracking by phone applications.

## How to Use the Blocklists

You can use these blocklists in a variety of ways:

- **DNS-Based Solutions**: Configure these domains with DNS servers like Pi-Hole, AdGuard, or your router's DNS settings to block the tracking domains.
- **Hosts File Redirection**: Download the blocklist and replace your system's hosts file to block these domains locally.
- **Browser Extensions**: For users who want to block these domains in their browsers, you can use extensions like uBlock Origin and configure them with these lists.

## Contribute

We welcome contributions! If you have additional app tracking domains to add or suggestions to improve the blocklist, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
